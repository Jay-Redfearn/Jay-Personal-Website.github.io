	<h2>About Me</h2>
		
	<p>My name is Jay Henderson Redfearn III, and I am an aspiring politican and former entrepreneur. My life's ambition is to make a difference in the lives around me by promoting effective policy while mainting current budgets and keeping economic prosperity!
		<br><br>
		I founded my first business, Redfearn Phone Repair, Inc., when I was 17 years old. Redfearn Phone Repair was a corporation that I had formed here in the State of Oklahoma with the purpose of fixing individual's broken iPhones. I started the company because I had a desire to become my own boss and make a difference in my community.
		<br><br> 
		I am currently a student at the University of Tulsa working towards a B.S.B.A. with a concentration in Computer Information Systems and a minor in Finance. I am a candidate of the Sigma Nu Fraternity, a member of the Sounds of the Golden Hurricane, and the Founder and former Treasurer and of Young Americans for Liberty.
